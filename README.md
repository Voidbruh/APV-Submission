# APV-Submission

This was my Submission to the Hackathon by the Astro Particle Physics Club at IIT PATNA, the Hackathon was about machine learning and it was first ever hackathon, I learnt a lot by trying out new models and preprocessing steps. The problems were all Astrology themed so it took me some time to get it but I ended up finishing all 3 problems with good accuracy scores.

My team ended up Securing the 2nd Position in this Hackathon.

These are the Problem Statements
